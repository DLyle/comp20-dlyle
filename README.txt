I am most proud of the Where in the World Project. The result was something very
useable, and it worked very well with the Google Maps API. 

My favorite project so far has been the final group project. I really working
with a team, and its fun to build something that is completely your own idea. 

In this class I have learned a lot about the way the web is structured and used.
I learned how everything is accessed through Http request and response. I
learned how to use html and css to format and style content. I learned how to
use javascript to manipulate this content. I learned how to build a web app
using heroku, node.js and express. Lastly, I learned about web security. 
Specifically how to break poorly designed web code and how to design your code 
to be secure.
