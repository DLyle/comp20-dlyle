<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The scorecenter app can be used to store the highscores for any html5 game.
Using a post API a user can post the highscores for any game and user to the
app. They can also use a get API to retrieve a json of the top 10 scores for any
game. The homepage 'http://infinite-hollows-6307.herokuapp.com/' will display
all the scores for all the games that are stored with this app. The usersearch
page, 'http://infinite-hollows-6307.herokuapp.com/usersearch', will allow a user
to search for the highscores of any user. I was hired to test this application,
and find any security flaws that may ruin its integrity. </p>

<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>In testing this application, I first examined the interface without seeing
the source code. I tried posting to it from my Frogger game, and examining the
results on the homepage. I also searched for different users on the usersearch
page. After black box texting, I examine the source code. Here I was looking for
how the coder handled input, and other unhandled boundary cases that malicious
users could exploit.</p>

<a name="findings"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>Most of the flaws found during my assessment can be attributed to lack of
input sanitization. This means that the user can post basically anything to the
application through the post API. They can also enter anything into the user
search bar. The lack of sanitization in the post API is more serious because
this input is displayed as html on the homepage. This means that a hacker could
post their own code to run when the homepage is accessed. A hacker could also
post some huge amount of data to the application that would crash the database.
The final problem that I found while reviewing the source code, is that anybody
can post or get from the application. This is problematic because users can ruin
the integrity of the site by posting from a site that is not an approved html5
game.</p>



<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<ol>
<li><h2>No Restriction on Cross Origin Sharing</h2></li>
<ul>
<li>Location: web.js - post API to submit.json<li>
<li>Severity: HIGH - Anyone can post highscores with game titles that are not
their own. This ruins the integrity of the site which is supposed to keep track
of highscores for games.</li>
<li>Description: The cross origin sharing is enabled in the header with a '*'.
This means that any site can post to the application. The high scores that they
post could be false (e.g. not from valid games or fake scores from real
games).</li>
<li>Resolution: Keep a white list of games that can post to this application. If
someone tries to post to the api that is not on the white list, they will be
denied access.</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>No Sanitization of Post API Input</h2></li>
<ul>
<li>Location: web.js - post API to submit.json</li>
<li>Severity: HIGH - malicious scripts can be injected and will run on the home
page. These scripts could mangle the page or redirect to a new site.</li>
<li>Description: The input to the post API is stored in the database and then
displayed as html on the homepage. A hacker could change the username
game_title, or score field to contain javascript code within script tags. This
code will then be executed on the homepage. This ruins the integrity of the
site.</li>
<li>Resolution: Sanitize the input to make sure that it does not contain script
or any other html tags. This will prevent users from writing code to mess up the
appearance of the page.</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>No Input Size Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Location: web.js - post API to submit.json</li>
<li>Severity: HIGH - a huge input could crash the database</li>
<li>Description: the input to the post API does not have a size limit. The user
could theoretically post a score that is a terrabyte long. Something this large
cannot be stored in a mongo document and the database would be comprimised. A
smaller but still annoyingly long input will ruin the appearance of the homepage
when it is displayed</li>
<li>Resolution: Put a cap on the length of the inputs stored in the database.
Either truncate the input or return an error so that malicious users cannot harm
the application in this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h2>Comments in the Source Code</h2>
<ul>
<li>Location: web.js</li>
<li>Severity: Low - The comments give away unnecessary information and make the
code look sloppy</li>
<li>Description: The source code contains some long commented out sections.
These reveal unnecessary information about the code and are not good style. The
comments present in this application do not give away much information, but it
is still a practice that should be avoided.</li>
<li>Resolution: Remove comments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<a name="conclusion"></a><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The code for this assignment is generally well designed and works correctly.
However there are several serious security flaws. Before this code is deployed
for wide public use, these issues must be addressed. If they are ignored the
  appliaction will be vulnerable and easily compromised by any malicious user. </p>
